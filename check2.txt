The most evident causes of global warming are industrialisation, urbanisation, deforestation, sophisticated human lifestyle and related human activities. These human activities and trends have led to increased emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etc. These gases in turn has led to an increase in average temperature of earth’s surface, hence global warming history.Greenhouse effect is a natural process wherein sunlight passes through atmosphere, warming earth’s surface. Then, the earth’s surface and water bodies release energy in form of heat or infrared radiations into atmosphere and maintains balance with the incoming energy. Greenhouse gases can absorb some of the infrared radiation. But increase in greenhouse gases has led to more absorbation of infrared radiation which in turn has led to the increase of earth’s surface temperature.There is no doubt that the ever increasing phenomenon of global warming would lead to a total extinction of any form of life from earth’s face. Global warming deplets the ozone layer and might lead us to the doom’s day. It is a wake-up call for us to amend our ways of living to limit the use of products that contribute to the increase in global warming. For our sake and for existence of all life on our heavenly planet earth, it is the need of the hour that we make sincere efforts and attempts to contain the monster called ‘global warming’.
